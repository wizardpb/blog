Hey. My name is Paul Bennett. I'm an independent developer/architect/agile coach, fascinated by the process of developing software in teams. 
I've been a doing all of this for - let's say, a number of years. The number ? Well, my graduate project was done on a PDP 11/34 with 
256k of main memory, running Unix Version 6, so guess away :-)

I've gone through many languages and methodologies, from C/C++ through Smalltalk, Ruby, Java, Groovy, and right now, I'm obsessed with Clojure. 
Let's just say I'm in recovery from a long period of OO addiction.

My other obsession is Agile. More and more, I come to see software development as nothing more than a team effort in communication. 
Agile is, so far, *the* most productive way of developing software, primarily because it enables high bandwidth, low error communication, with an baked-in mechanism for 
regularly checking and correcting the results of that communication. As much as I love building software, my focus these days is as an Agile coach and mentor.
